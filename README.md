# AI-Chat-Bot-Engagement-Analysis

Project Description:

I developed a Chat Analytics Power BI dashboard for the Marketing and Customer Support teams, leveraging SQL queries and Excel data to offer insights into chat volume, response times, customer satisfaction (CSAT), and team performance. The dashboard tracks chat conversion rates (CR), identifies areas for improvement, and helps set new KPI benchmarks.

Technology Stack:

Power BI: Data visualization and reporting
SQL: Querying live chat data
Excel: Data cleaning and integration
MarketingDB & CRM System: Data sources for chat metrics

Key Features:

Chat Data Tracking: Visualizes daily, weekly, and termly chat volumes, revealing trends over time.

Response Time Analysis: Monitors average response times to ensure SLA compliance.

Conversion Rate Analysis (CR): Tracks chat-to-conversion success for different sessions.

Team-wise Performance: Breaks down chat metrics by team, evaluating departmental performance.

Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Measures feedback post-chat to highlight improvement areas.

Geographical Insights: Tracks performance across regions and countries for better service consistency.
